# PotwPkg

PotwPkg is a library/package designed to support the POTW (Project of the Week)
ecosystem by providing core functionalities that can be reused across the frontend (web
application) and backend (functions).

## NX

NX is a smart and extensible build system with a modular approach for managing
large-scale projects, especially monorepos. It provides powerful tools for managing
dependencies, caching, building, and testing, making it ideal for modern development
projects.

PotwPkg is built on top of NX to leverage its efficient build and dependency management
features, enabling the seamless sharing of code and utilities between the frontend and
backend of the POTW ecosystem.

Key benefits of NX that PotwPkg utilizes:

- **Monorepo Support**: Centralized management of shared code and dependencies across
  multiple projects.
- **Efficient Builds**: Incremental builds and caching mechanisms help optimize build
  times.
- **Consistent Tooling**: Shared configurations and development tools for consistency
  across projects.
- **Modular Structure**: Encourages modular development, making it easier to extend and
  maintain the project.
- **Code Sharing**: Facilitates seamless sharing of logic and utilities between the POTW
  web application and backend functions.

### POTW FUNCTIONS

The repository for the POTW backend functions. This repository contains serverless
functions or APIs that power the backend of the POTW project, handling business logic,
database interactions, and more.

[GitHub Repository - POTW FUNCTIONS](https://github.com/quirkles/potw-functions)

## Features

- **Reusable Core Utilities**: A set of helper functions and utilities commonly required
  by both the frontend and backend.
- **Shared Code**: Logic that reduces duplication between the web and function
  repositories.
- **Modular Design**: Easy-to-use and extend for different use cases.
